CODETOON

	Codetoon is a game that aims to teach basic java programming to the beginners by
associating entertainment and coding, providing a new way of learning. It basicly consists 
of two part, a 2D platform game on the left hand side and a basic IDE on the right hand side.
Demolishing popular demands, the main character of the platform game part is a princess, who 
walks and surpasses obstacles. She is moved horizontally with the right and left arrow keys and
can be jumped by the up arrow or the space keys. When she comes across an obstacle, her moves
become limited to nothing and a problem from the database to be solved is showed on a text field 
at the top of the IDE part. Other than the porblem it self, this part also contains text fields to 
write the solution of the problem in java and to see the compiler output of the code written as well 
as the compile and run button. If the answer is not correct, character loses a life and can try again 
until she runs out of lives which makes the player to start the game all over again. If the answer is
 correct, she becomes able to move again until coming across to the next obstacle. After completing 
three levels, the game is finished.

	Our game also includes java tutorial options that gives significant information about java
programming and its subtitles to inform the beginner user before getting started. It also has a hint
button which shows some specific tips and tricks to ease the problems.


	Status: The game, the basic IDE and the database works fully seperately. Although the connection
is done between the game and the IDE, there are still mistakes in the connection between the IDE and the
database which we still work on.
